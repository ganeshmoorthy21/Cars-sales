        "TensorFlow 2.0 is an upgraded version of TensorFlow that emphasizes ease of use, flexibility, and integration with high-level APIs like Keras. It enables eager execution by default, which means operations execute immediately as they are called, making debugging and development easier. Unlike TensorFlow 1.x, which relied heavily on static computational graphs requiring explicit session management, TensorFlow 2.0 simplifies this with a more intuitive and Pythonic approach. Additionally, deprecated and redundant APIs were removed or replaced to streamline functionality."
